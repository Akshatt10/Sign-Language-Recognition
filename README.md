# Sign-Language-Recognition

Sign Language is a form of communication used primarily by people hard of hearing or deaf. This type of gesture-based language allows people to convey ideas and thoughts easily overcoming the barriers caused by difficulties from hearing issues.

A Deep-learning based solution
Convert sign language involving multiple gestures into meaningful words 
OpenCV for labelling and utilizing the webcam as the source input
Keras for model training
Python as the core programming language
Our approach is simple and confined in order to have user-friendly application in order to minimize the problems faced by the deaf individuals.
